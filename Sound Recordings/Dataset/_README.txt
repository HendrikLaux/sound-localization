Information:

The Speaker position and orientation is unchanged for all measurements.

The stimulation signal is a rectangular pulse of height 1 and a width of 100 samples.
This is a theoretical consideration, real physical speakers will always falsify (at least low-pass filter) the signal.
For learning, this is not a problem as long as the falsification is constant/reproducable.

Recordings are sorted into 6 desk and 2 floor positions with various disturbances. 
The disturbed recording sets have been obtained without touching the microphone in between the sets (no additional disturbances).
Measurements have been obtained automatically (20 in a row) for one position with 250ms delay between recording start and sound emission.
Each recording was recorded in a 2 second time slot, resulting in 1750ms time for the stimulation sound to decay. 

Recording Sets:
Each recording set contains pictures of the setup (with and without optional additional disturbances by damping, microphone tilt or reflective disturbance).
A recording set contains 20 measurements. Those are uncut and unsorted (there might be few recordings that are disturbed by the noise at the institute)
The mat-Files contain labeled sound data (sampled data) with additional information and labels.


Note: various audio processing delays cause the stimulation responses NOT to be synchronized (starting at the same time/sample).
	Thresholding/Filtering is mandatory for meaningful use of the data.
